        <h1>Terrain-Optimized Suspension and Wheel Architecture for Harsh Environments</h1>
        <p style="margin-top:1cm;"></p>
        <p>Hypersonic’s mobility architecture is built around an enhanced rocker-bogie suspension integrated with a CNC-machined arched base support designed to distribute loads efficiently across all six wheels. This geometry improves traction, shock absorption, and terrain adaptability on slopes exceeding 25° and on highly fractured surfaces. The arched base reduces stress concentrations at the wheel joints and increases wheel-ground contact consistency, which is crucial for tasks involving steep climbs and heavy payload retrieval. The chassis panels incorporate a weight-reducing Jamdani-inspired pattern, fabricated through CNC machining, which achieves nearly a 10% mass reduction without compromising torsional rigidity. This system ensures stability, power efficiency, and mission reliability in unpredictable field conditions. </p>

        <p class="subtitle"> Motivation & Constraints:</p>
        <p style="margin-top:1cm;"></p>
        <p>The primary objective was to improve slope stability and traction reliability compared to last year’s rover,
            which struggled on uneven rocks and loose soil. This redesign matters because the rover must safely carry
            science payloads, retrieve cache boxes, and navigate long distances without losing balance or causing wheel
            motor overload. </p>

        <p class="subtitle"> Results & Evaluation</p>
        <p style="margin-top:1cm;"></p>


        <p>The redesigned wheel system exceeded the initial objective by increasing stability by approximately 22%
            during slope trials and reducing chassis vibration by an estimated 18%. The weight reduction improved
            battery runtime by roughly 9%. Field tests showed a significant improvement in wheel-ground adherence across
            rocky surfaces, though minor slipping still occurred on loose sand, indicating a future need for tread
            pattern optimization. </p>

        <p class="subtitle">My Contributions:</p>
        <p style="margin-top:1cm;"></p>

        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Optimized the load-bearing geometry of the arched base, increasing slope stability by ~22% over the
                previous model.</li>
            <li>Machined CNC-patterned wheel panels inspired by Jamdani design, reducing system weight by ~10%.</li>
            <li>Analyzed ground clearance and rocker-bogie articulation across 15+ simulated terrains to ensure obstacle
                negotiation.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="subtitle"> Learnings:</p>
        <p style="margin-top:1cm;"></p>

        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wheel slip was still noticeable on loose sandy terrain → need to redesign tread geometry for better soil
                engagement.</li>
            <li>Rocker-bogie articulation needed additional damping at extreme joint angles → learned importance of
                integrating compliance elements.</li>

            <li>CNC machining of thin patterned panels introduced distortion → refined tolerance strategies to prevent
                warping.</li>
            <li>Terrain simulations did not perfectly match real-world soil conditions → learned to incorporate physical
                soil testing sooner in the process.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>


        <p class="subtitle"> Reflection (What didn’t work & next iteration):</p>
        <p style="margin-top:1cm;"></p>
        <p>
            Initially, I underestimated how much the patterned CNC cuts would reduce stiffness in localized regions.
            Early prototypes showed minor flexing under high torque loads. I learned to balance aesthetic weight
            reduction with finite element analysis constraints and implemented reinforcement ribs in later iterations.
            This improved overall durability without significant weight gain.
