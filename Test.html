        <h1>Multi-Stage Testing Framework Ensuring System Reliability</h1>
        <p style="margin-top:1cm;"></p>
        <p>Testing for Hypersonic followed a structured three-phase pipeline: subsystem validation, complete system testing, and operational mission trials. Subsystem testing evaluated CAD structures, wheel durability, communications (5 GHz, FPV, 900 MHz), camera systems, and power modules. Full-system testing from January to May 2025 validated mechanical assembly, autonomous navigation, and control system integration. Operational field tests confirmed the rover’s capabilities in soil collection, sample analysis, ES tasks, and cache retrieval. This iterative testing strategy ensured that all components were validated individually and in combination under realistic mission conditions. </p>

        <p class="subtitle"> Motivation & Constraints:</p>
        <p style="margin-top:1cm;"></p>
        <p>Testing matters because rover competitions penalize instability, control failures, and inconsistent task performance. With a limited five-month window and overlapping subsystem schedules, the goal was to build a testing framework that minimized downtime and maximized failure detection. Constraints included limited field-testing locations, tight component availability, and strict competition deadlines. </p>

        <p class="subtitle"> Results & Evaluation</p>
        <p style="margin-top:1cm;"></p>


        <p>Testing revealed system weaknesses early, allowing redesigns that improved mechanical durability and autonomous accuracy. The testing pipeline reduced integration delays by ~20% and contributed to a more stable final system. However, weather variations and uneven testing environments introduced inconsistencies, suggesting a need for controlled indoor test rigs in future cycles. </p>

        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Weather fluctuations affected outdoor tests → learned the necessity of indoor test alternatives.</li>
            <li>Some failures only appeared after prolonged testing → emphasized the importance of endurance tests.</li>

            <li>Communication modules interfered under certain antenna angles → redesigned mounting positions.</li>
            <li>Soil sample tests required consistent soil conditions → developed standardized testing procedures.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="subtitle"> Reflection (What didn’t work & next iteration):</p>
        <p style="margin-top:1cm;"></p>
        <p>
            In early integrated tests, communication systems intermittently dropped when multiple antennas operated simultaneously. I learned to map RF interference zones and reposition antennas to minimize cross-coupling. This experience highlighted the need for RF-aware mechanical design from the start, not late in integration.
